   <section class="intro">
   	  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

   	    <h3>Project Vision</h3>
   	    <p>Hope is a personal project that is designed for the Google certificate program. It is designed for a conceptualized organization that focused on helping others. The organization needs a tool that helps people to donate their used or unused product and recycle materials to save the earth. Hope’s primary target users include college students and adults who want to donate products and would like to learn more about what they can do to help others and save the environment.</p>

   	    <h3>Problem</h3>
   	    <p>Huge amount of products can be recycled and the earth can be saved by them. Moreover, many people in need can be helped with all kind of donations. Hope has identified a lack of general knowledge about recycling materials among people and limited time of them to go physically to a donation place to donate things.</p>

   	    <h3>Goal</h3>
   	    <p>Design a cross-platform tool that will help others and save the environment by letting people know which are the recyclable products and help them use a pick-up service to donate things from home.</p>

   	    <h3>My Role</h3>
   	    <p>UX designer. Designing an app for Hope from conception to delivery.</p>

   	    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
   	    <p>Conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, iterating on designs, determining information architecture, and responsive design.</p>

   	    <h3>Duration</h3>
   	    <p>November 2021</p>

    	<h2>User Research</h2>
    	<h3>Understanding the User</h3>
    	<p>I conducted user interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and their needs. Most interview participants reported feeling positively about helping others and saving the environment, but they didn’t actively try to help others do their part of saving. The feedback received through research made it very clear that users would be open and willing to donate things if they had access to an easy-to-use tool to help & guide them.</p>

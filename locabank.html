<!------User Research------>
    <section class="page-coverage">
    	<h2>User Research</h2>
    	<h3>Understanding the User</h3>
    	<p>I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand the target user and their needs. I discovered that many target users do online banking and find it easy rather than visiting a bank and stand  in the que. However, many banking websites are overwhelming and confusing to navigate, which frustrates many target users. This caused a normal experience to become challenging for them.</p>

   	 <h3>Paper Wireframe Screen Size Variation</h3>

     <p>After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I created the initial designs for the LocaBank website.  Prioritizing useful button locations and visual element placement on the home page was a key part of my strategy.</p>

	<h3>Mockups</h3>

   	    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
   	    <h3>Impact</h3>
   	    <p>Our target users shared that the design was intuitive to navigate through, more engaging with the images, and demonstrated a clear visual hierarchy.</p>

   	    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
   	    <p>I learned that even a small design change can have a huge impact on the user experience. The most important takeaway for me is to always focus on the real needs of the users when coming up with design ideas and solutions.</p>

   	    <h5>Future Steps</h5>
   	    <p>I am proud of what I have designed. However, the website is never finished.</p>

   	    <h3>Testing</h3>
   	    <p>Conduct follow-up usability testing on the new website.</p>

   	    <h3>Ideation</h3>
   	    <p>Identify any additional areas of need and ideate on new features.</p>

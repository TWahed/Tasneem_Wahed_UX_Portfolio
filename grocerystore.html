    	<h3>Understanding the User</h3>
    	<p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I was designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was working adults who don’t have time to grocery shopping.<br>This user group confirmed initial assumptions about Grocery Store customers, but research also revealed that time was not the only factor limiting users from going to grocery shops. Other user problems included obligations, interests, or challenges (like the covid pandemic issue) that make it challenging to get groceries.</p>

<!------Going Forward------>

   <section class="page-coverage">
   	  <h2>Going Forward</h2>

   	    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
   	    <h3>Impact</h3>
   	    <p>The app makes users feel like Grocery Store really thinks about how to meet their needs. <br>One quote from peer feedback: <br>“The app is so easy to navigate and order from that I would definitely use this app to order my groceries and track the order while staying at home during this pandemic.”</p>

   	    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
   	    <p>While designing the Grocery Store app, I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app’s designs.</p>

   	    <h5>Future Steps</h5>
   	    <p>I am proud of what I have designed. However, if I get a chance, I would love to iterate on my design according to the following steps-.</p>

   	    <h3>Testing</h3>
   	    <p>Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed.</p>

   	    <h3>User Research</h3>
   	    <p>Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need.</p>
